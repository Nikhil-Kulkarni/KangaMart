The *Uber* for any consumer product delivery

People strive to be more productive and effective with their time. 

For money strapped college students managing heavy courseloads, jobs and a social life, it may become unfeasible to purchase a car, drive to the grocery store, and 
purchase food, even while it may be the cheaper and healthier option compared to dining hall food. 

For mothers and fathers juggling demanding work and the responsibility of child rearing, driving to purchase goods at an electronics, home improvement or grocery store 
may mean sacrificing time with their children.

Any small business or restaurants that may not have the available work force to offer a delivery service but wants to grow and have a larger presence amongst consumers.

Homemakers and other people are looking to make a living and have idle time.

KangaMart tries to alleviate these groups' situations by connecting users available to *deliver* the goods with users who want to *order* the goods but devote 
themselves to other activities.
